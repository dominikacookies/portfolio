# Personal Portfolio

## Description
This project is a personal portfolio which has been built using html and css languages. 
The portfolio presents an overview of my skill set alongside 3 examples of projects I have previously worked on. 
If you'd like to get in touch, it also contains a link to my LinkedIn profile.

## Key Features
1. The site optimises for different screen sizes through the use of flexbox (USP section) and media queries (in multiple places)
2. The site showcases the current portfolio and contains placeholders for upcoming projects
3. When an item in the navigation bar is selected, the browser will scroll down to the relevant section
4. When the site loads, the image of the portfolio owner has been animated to ease in from the left
5. The site contains main information about the owner and a link to the LinkedIn
